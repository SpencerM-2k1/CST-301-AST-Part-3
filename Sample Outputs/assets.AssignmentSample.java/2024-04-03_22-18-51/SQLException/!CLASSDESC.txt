An exception that provides information on a database access
 error or other errors.

 Each SQLException provides several kinds of information:
 
 a string describing the error.  This is used as the Java Exception
       message, available via the method getMesasge.
    a "SQLstate" string, which follows either the XOPEN SQLstate conventions
        or the SQL:2003 conventions.
       The values of the SQLState string are described in the appropriate spec.
       The DatabaseMetaData method getSQLStateType
       can be used to discover whether the driver returns the XOPEN type or
       the SQL:2003 type.
    an integer error code that is specific to each vendor.  Normally this will
       be the actual error code returned by the underlying database.
    a chain to a next Exception.  This can be used to provide additional
       error information.
    the causal relationship, if any for this SQLException.
