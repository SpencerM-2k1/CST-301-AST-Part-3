The String class represents character strings. All
 string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are
 implemented as instances of this class.
 
 Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they
 are created. String buffers support mutable strings.
 Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:
 
     String str = "abc";
 
 is equivalent to:
 
     char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
     String str = new String(data);
 
 Here are some more examples of how strings can be used:
 
     System.out.println("abc");
     String cde = "cde";
     System.out.println("abc" + cde);
     String c = "abc".substring(2,3);
     String d = cde.substring(1, 2);
 

 The class String includes methods for examining
 individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for
 searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a
 copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to
 lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version
 specified by the Character class.
 
 The Java language provides special support for the string
 concatenation operator ( + ), and for conversion of
 other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented
 through the StringBuilder(or StringBuffer)
 class and its append method.
 String conversions are implemented through the method
 toString, defined by Object and
 inherited by all classes in Java. For additional information on
 string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele,
 The Java Language Specification.

  Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor
 or method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be
 thrown.

 A String represents a string in the UTF-16 format
 in which supplementary characters are represented by surrogate
 pairs (see the section Unicode
 Character Representations in the Character class for
 more information).
 Index values refer to char code units, so a supplementary
 character uses two positions in a String.
 The String class provides methods for dealing with
 Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for
 dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., char values).

=== CLASS TAGS ===
Label<`Data Structure`>:
- The String class in Java is a fundamental data structure for storing sequences of characters and is used to manipulate text data.

Label<`Language`>:
- The description details the internal language features, such as string literals, immutability, and methods for string manipulation, which are inherent to Java as a programming language.

Label<`Software Development and IT`>:
- String handling is a core aspect of software development, and understanding the String class is essential for version control, continuous integration, and continuous delivery within Java environments.
