A Statement object represents a primitive statement
 in which a single method is applied to a target and
 a set of arguments - as in "a.setFoo(b)".
 Note that where this example uses names
 to denote the target and its argument, a statement
 object does not require a name space and is constructed with
 the values themselves.
 The statement object associates the named method
 with its environment as a simple set of values:
 the target and an array of argument values.

=== CLASS TAGS ===
Label<`Data Structure`>:
- The class description fits with 'Data Structure' because it discusses a way of organizing data (the target and an array of argument values) and the relationships between them (the method applied).

Label<`Software Development and IT`>:
- It also aligns with 'Software Development and IT' as it pertains to the construction and association of methods with objects, which is a common practice in software development.

Label<`Logic`>:
- Additionally, the description matches 'Logic' since it involves the logical association of a method with its environment and set of values, reflecting a framework or pattern used in programming.
